11g Enhancements 
================

a) Compound Triggers




b) We can DISABLE the trigger during creation itself.
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER tr2
BEFORE INSERT ON test
FOR EACH ROW
DISABLE -->> 11g onwards.
DECLARE
 ..
 ..
BEGIN
 ..
 ..
END;
/

c) Using FOLLOWS keyword to change the hierarchy of the triggers.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER tr1
BEFORE INSERT ON test
FOR EACH ROW
FOLLOWS tr2  -->> from 11g onwards
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line('111');
END;
/

"tr1"  follows "tr2"
