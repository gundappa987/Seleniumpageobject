NOTES:
======

- Between trigger & constraint, trigger is fired first .


- When we delete the records from a table then DELETE triggers are fired but for TRUNCATE statement, no delete triggers are fired.

- We cannot create a trigger for a SELECT statement

- The size of the trigger can be only upto 32K. If the size is more than this, create a separate SP/function and call the same from the trigger.

create or replace trigger test_trig
before delete on emp
begin
   ..
   ..
   test_sp; -- SP is called inside a trigger ..
   ..
   ..
end;
/


- The trigger can't return 
value. But use global variable to return the same..
  
trig1 ------writes a value-------> Global Variable ------> reads a value -->trig2

create or replace package testpack
is
	v1 number := 100;
end;
/

create or replace trigger t1
before insert on emp
begin
  testpack.v1 := 200;
end;
/

create or replace trigger t2
after insert on emp
begin
  dp (testpack.v1);
end;
/

** In the same way(global variables) we can also return a value from SP/Function withut using OUT parameters.

 
- A single trigger can be created only on a single table. If we want to create on multiple tables, then we should create a view from those two tables, then create a instead of trigger on the view.

create view v1
as
select a.ename, b,dname from emp a, dept b
where a.deptno=b.deptno
/

create or replace trigger test_t1
instead of delete on v1
begin
  ..
  ..
end;
/
