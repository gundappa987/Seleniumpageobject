DMLTrigger Hirerachy
====================

i)  before statement level [T1]

ii) before row level [T2]

<<triggering statement>>

iii) after row level [T3]

iv)  after statement level [T4]

====================================
** If 2 two triggers are differing only in EVENT 
(level & timing are same), then Oracle decides which one should fire first.

Eg:-
====

- Trigger  T2 -> BEFORE INSERT ON EMP for each row
- Trigger  T3 -> BEFORE INSERT ON EMP for each row

 ** Here any of  T2, T3 might be fired first. (ORACLE DECIDES)

=====================================

ASSIGNMENT
